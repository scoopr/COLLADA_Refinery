the installer

Part 2 - how to genearte the updates for different versions

edit field for old version number (1.0.0) and new version number(2.0.0)
enter a update description about the new features, bug fixes, etc
specify the paths to the different versions of the software

Click on 'Update Manage' tab and 'Create Update'
a window pops up asking for old version number and new version number
click file wizard to specify the paths to the different version of the software
click 'Distribute Update' and 'Compile Update', the Distribution Wizard will create binary patch 
for the files affected 
After the compilation is finished, click 'Distribute Update' and 'Publish Update', the Distribution
Wizard will upload the patch files to the remote server 

Note:
Current version of Flashupdate (version 1.3.6) has a bug when doing the binary patch on libloader.dll.
To work around the problem, follow the steps below.

When you run the “File Wizard” and specify the locations of the old and new versions of your software, 
the wizard defaults to PATCH files that are present in both v1.0 and v2.0. However you can easily change 
this by following these simple steps: 
  
1)       Remove the libloader.dll patch from the Update Files window. (Right-click on it, select delete) 
2)       Click on the “Copy Files…” button. 
3)       Browse to v2 of libloader.dll and select it. The file should now appear in the Update Files window. 
4)       Save your update. Compile it, and publish it using the Distribution Wizard.
