Refinery and Conditioners:
Original Author: Philippe David
Authors: Andrew Lorino, Herbert Law, Ling Liu, Steven Thomas

Prerequisites for *running* Refinery:

- Java Runtime Engine (JRE)
  Make sure the JRE bin folder is included in your path (the installer handles this automatically).

Prerequisites for *building* Refinery:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 or 2005

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
  Make sure that the environment variable JDK_HOME is set to the JDK bin folder (the
  installer handles this automatically).

How to build:

- Visual Studio 2003: Open projects/VC++7/Refinery.sln and build the solution.
- Visual Studio 2005: Open projects/VC++8/Refinery.sln and build the solution.

How to run:

- Navigate to the bin directory appropriate for your platform and execute refinery.bat.

or

- Open a command prompt, navigate to the bin directory appropriate for your platform,
  and execute "java -jar ..\..\refinery.jar"

Command line options:

$ java -jar refinery.jar --help
Refinery command line usage:
        refinery [options] (--execute-lib|-x) <libname> [liboptions]
                Execute the contionner called <libname> in the lib directory
                and pass all following options to this conditionner

        refinery [options] (--execute-macro|-m) <macroname> -i <input filename> -o <output filename>
                Execute the macro called <macroname> in the macro directory

        refinery [options] (--execute-file|-f) <filename>
                Execute the pipeline saved into <filename>

        refinery --list
                List all conditioners and macros found.

        refinery --help
                Print this message.

        refinery --help-lib <libname>
                Print description and options for a particular lib.                      

example 
$ refinery -i input.dae -o output.dae -x Axisconverter -axis X_UP
or
$ java -jar refinery.jar -i input.dae -o output.dae -x Axisconverter -axis X_UP

How to test

make runtest   

- run each dae files in dae_data directory with each conditioners executable.

make pip 
- run the test cases from saved pipeline files automatically (*)
- run the test cases from saved pipeline macros automatically (*)
*make sure the input/output files specified in .pip match what you have in your environment
                           
Available conditioner list 

Axisconverter       - convert the different up_axis (X_UP, Y_UP, Z_UP)  
  - option          - axis - which axis will become up axis

bindmaterialfixer   - add missing bind_material in instance_geometry if needed

coherencytest       - test the data integrety of COLLADA document
  - option          - log - the log file to save the test result to
                          - if it is not specify, the defualt is the same path and file name with .log extension						

copyrighter         - check whether the copyright is present if not add one
  - option          - Copyright - the new string for the copyright
                    - Overwrite - overwrite the existed coyright string

daestripper         - remove a specific element
  - option          - element - the element you want to remove
                    - attribute - the profile valueof the element you want to remove
  - example	    - element=extra - remove all extra element
                    - element=technique and attribute=any - remove all techique of any profile
                    - element=technique and attribute=MAYA - remove all techique of profile="MAYA"
					
deindexer           - take COLLADA data and put it in a form that is ready for use with GL vertex arrays
                      it will deindex all primitives inside a geometries,
                      rearrange vertice array, and all skins that use these vertice arrays.

detrifanner         - take trifans and convert back to triangles

detristripper       - take tristrips and convert back to triangles

filename            - convert all the image filenames to be relative to the position of the current COLLADA file
  - option          - Prefix - the string you want to put before files of <file> and <image> element
                    - image  - modify the image element also.
								   
imageconverter      - convert all images that are referenced from a specific COLLADA document to a desire image format
  - option	    - extension - the file extension format you want the image to convert to.

Lines2linestrips    - turn all lines to linestrips

Linestrips2lines    - turn all linestrips to lines

Optimizer           - optimize the primitives to improve the vertex cache hit rate
